I have cloned a website and I want to modify it without changing its UI/UX structure. 
Keep the same layout, same content, and same images. 
Only improve quality and make the site look clean and professional.

Here are the exact changes I want:

1. **Brand Updates**
   - Change the website name everywhere to: “Campus Pathway”
   - Replace all old phone numbers with: <your phone number>
   - Replace logo placeholder with a clean minimal education-themed logo (you can generate an SVG).

2. **Color Scheme Update (Do Not Change Layout)**
   Replace the entire color palette with these modern colors:
       Primary: #0D1B2A (Navy Blue)
       Secondary: #F4D35E (Golden Yellow)
       Accent: #1B263B
       Text Color: #0A0A0A
       Background: #FFFFFF
   Apply these colors to:
       - Buttons
       - Headings
       - Background sections
       - Icons
       - Highlights

3. **Improve Visual Quality — But Keep Same Design**
   - Add smooth fade-in animations (subtle)
   - Add light hover effects (minimal, no layout changes)
   - Improve typography and spacing for a cleaner look
   - Sharpen card shadows and edges
   - Ensure the design stays exactly the same, just cleaner and more premium

4. **Form Functionality Update**
   - Any form a user fills must:
        • Send data to admin email: <your email>
        • Also store the submission in backend database (MySQL / Postgres)
   - Add proper validation and a success message:
        “Thanks! Our team will contact you soon.”

5. **Backend Fixes**
   - Update backend routes/controllers to handle form submissions
   - Use environment variables for DB and email settings
   - Ensure everything works in production

6. **General Improvements**
   - Clean unused CSS/JS
   - Make the site fully responsive
   - Optimize images, fonts, and loading time

7. **Important**
   - Do NOT change the layout, images, structure, or content order.
   - Only update colors, brand details, and code quality.
   - Keep UI/UX exactly same.

Make all these changes directly in the code and explain major edits.
